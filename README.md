## Task:

Create a Report Which Uses EPC Data to display information about a given address. (EPC is Energy Performance data gathered about a building / address to show how energy efficient the property is).

Use the Energy Performance Certificates API - which is an open API of publicly available energy performance data.
You can Register for your own API key, or we can provide a key to use if required.

## Code Requirements:

    Code should be written in JavaScript or PHP. The resulting code should not have any external dependencies required to run
    Code should be easy to read & the front-end HTML/CSS should follow W3C standards
    You can choose to create your own API Key, or we can provide one for you to use (see link in the sidebar).

 

## Functionality Requirements:

    Allow the user to Input a UK Residential Address/Postcode using a HTML Form
    Find & display suitable matching records in the API based on the address / postcode they provide
    Allow the user to then select a single property and display the full EPC details available.
    Optional: Include some analysis of the returned data, for example this could include:
        Comparison of the energy performance of this property to other neighbouring/nearby properties, using an average of their performance.
        Or changes compared to any previous EPC for the same address, such as an increase/decrease of some numbers, or the addition/removal of recommended actions.
